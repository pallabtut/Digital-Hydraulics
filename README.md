Designing of model based control in Digital Hydraulics
The objective for the project work is to work with Digital Valve system and to design a model-based controller. The system consists of a supply unit along with a digital valve system and an asymmetric cylinder moving load mass vertically. The following subsystems were designed for the above system.
• Upper level controller
• Model based valve controller
• Valve system
• Cylinder and load
